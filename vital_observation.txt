v v v imp question
Million dollars !!
qs) for loop is in use
    we try to alter the orginal set/list/dict
    alter means - either you add a new element OR you delete 
    an existing element
    what happens?
answer) list - nothing , it will delete
               but when you append - it is very BAD practice
               system will CRASH
        set - you get error
        RuntimeError: Set changed size during iteration
        
        dict - RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration
        for k,v in lst1.items():
            print(k,v)
            if v == 99:
               lst1.pop(k)
