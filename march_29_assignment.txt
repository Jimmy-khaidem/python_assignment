March 29th assignment
======================
(write functions, call functions, make it return values)
1. input the principle, rate and time
   compute the simple interest and amount
   SI = ( P x T x R ) / 100
   Amount = SI + P
   .......
   should have (say) functions like this
   input_data()
   compute_interest()
   display_amount()
   display_simple_interest()

2. given to you a prod_dict = 
            Price  quantity
              /    /
   { 1000: (72.55,10), 2000 : (56.25,5), 3000: (25.25,15) }
   given prod_name = { 1000: 'Toothpaste', 2000 : 'Soap' , 3000 : 'Campor' }
   the user is asked to enter the prod name
   and let say the user inputs Soap
   then display the amount accordingly
   also display the quantity available
   ask the user how much to buy ? if the buying qty inputted is 
   less than or equal to available qty then go ahead with transaction
   otherwise display 'Asked qty is NOT available'
   on transaction being successful deduct the qty accordingly and update
   Keep doing this till the user say - wish to quit ? YES

3. set1 = { 100, 560,220, 565,121, 10, 15}
   list1 = [890,560,-220, -565, 12,-10 , 14,22,15]
   process the set1 , pick the element and search in the list1
   if the element exists in the list1 (either poistive or negative)
   example say  10 OR -10 then delete it from the list1
   count how many got deleted.
   Once the delete count exceeds 4 then STOP otherwise go ahead and process 
   the set1
